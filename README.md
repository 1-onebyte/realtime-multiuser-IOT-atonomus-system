# realtime-multiuser-IOT-atonomus-system

A real‑time **ESP32‑based IoT system** that continuously monitors multiple sensors, detects faults, automatically switches to backup mechanisms, and visualizes system health on a **live Firebase‑powered dashboard**.

This project demonstrates **self‑healing automation**, **fault tolerance**, and **real‑time cloud synchronization**, suitable for smart factories, power systems, and industrial automation.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional IoT systems fail silently when:
- A sensor stops working
- Network connectivity is lost
- Overload conditions occur

This leads to downtime, unsafe operation, and delayed human intervention.

---

## Solution Overview

Our system introduces:
- **Primary & Backup Sensors**
- **Automatic fault detection**
- **Local fallback when network fails**
- **Cloud‑based real‑time monitoring**
- **Clear system status visualization**

The system continues operating safely even during failures.

## Key Features

- Real‑time sensor monitoring (ESP32)
- Automatic switch to backup sensor
- Fault & overload detection
- Safe mode activation
- Firebase Realtime Database sync
- Live web dashboard (Digital Twin)
- Multi‑user real‑time access
